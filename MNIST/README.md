# MNIST
---
**My Experiment with MNIST dataset, 99.014% accuracy on Kaggle public test set**
- 99.014% achieved by 3x3 filter size for conv1 and conv2, 1/3 keep prob in training, no 24x24 sampling
- I am using Fstring and typing hint so at lease Python3.6
- create a virtualenv
- `pip install -r requirents.txt`
- I have to do `ipython kernel install --name "csc497" --user` to create a virtualenv kernel for notebook

**TODO**
- [ ] unittest
- [ ] ???
